Traffic increased on the web. Caching was the first major tech to attempt:
- reduce user-perceived (client side) latency
- reduce transmission of redundant traffic on the network
Something was noticed: Users visited the same sites over and over again. 

The Chapter provides an overview of caching in two parts:

1. basics and mechanics of caching:
Overview of the chapter begins with historical evolution of caching and its "high-level" goals.
The next four sections speak about:
- why: speaks about motivation of caching at each stage of the request from client to server. 
- what: speaks about the issues when deciding if a message (response) is cacheable or not. 
- where: speaks about the place where the caching will take place on the path between client and server.
- how: speaks about the cashing system/software and the steps it goes through.
Overview proceeds speaking about cache-replacement and -coherency and the effect on cashing decisions brought by the rate of resources-changes.

2. practice of caching:
Speaks about communication between caches and the protocols used for this communication. 
Speaks also about soft- and hardware used in caching.
Software part speaks about Squid-caching-system. Hardware part examines industry practice. 
Further topics like:
- problems with caching at commercial and social level
- "replication": concept similar to caching
- content distribution and adaptation
will also be discussed in this chapter.
